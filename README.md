# Cook Recipes
Making a recipe website had been on my mind for awhile. It wasn't until recently that my database (brain) started to have more than just a few recipes stored. Before I would save a rough list of ingredients needed for certain recipes on my phone or save chrome tabs or instagram reels, or just rely on memory. I created this to immortalize recipes that I have made and can vouch for, and to hopefully motivate my friends to try a new dish today.
